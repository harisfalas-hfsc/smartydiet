const TITLE = "SmartyDiet FAQ — plans, pricing, privacy & accuracy";
const DESCRIPTION =
  "Answers to common questions about SmartyDiet: what you get in a plan, how the AI meal planner works, pricing, privacy, allergies and accuracy.";

const ITEMS: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  {
    q: "What is SmartyDiet?",
    a: "SmartyDiet is a personalized AI diet planner. It turns a smart questionnaire into a fully personalized meal plan with calories, macros, portions and a weekly grocery list, plus free tools like BMR, TDEE, macro and calorie calculators.",
  },

  {
    q: "What do I get with a SmartyDiet plan?",
    a: "You get a full 1, 2 or 4-week personalized meal plan with daily meals, portions, calorie and macro totals, a weekly grocery list sorted by category, and a short rationale explaining why the plan fits your goal. You can export it as a PDF and download a printable grocery list.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is SmartyDiet different from generic calorie trackers?",
    a: "A calorie tracker gives you a number. SmartyDiet gives you a plan. It assesses your body, goals, allergies, food preferences and schedule, then generates a personalized meal plan with portions and a grocery list — no manual logging required.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is SmartyDiet different from a human dietitian?",
    a: "A human dietitian can diagnose and treat medical conditions; SmartyDiet cannot. What SmartyDiet does do is package the assessment, calculation and planning work of a dietitian into an always-available AI, at a one-time price of $4.99 instead of a per-session fee.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does the AI meal planner work?",
    a: "You answer a smart questionnaire (body, goals, activity, food preferences, allergies, schedule). SmartyDiet computes your calorie and macro targets using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, then the AI builds a meal plan that respects every constraint you entered. You get 2 refinements included.",
  },

  {
    q: "How accurate are the calorie, BMI, BMR and macro calculators?",
    a: "SmartyDiet uses the Mifflin-St Jeor equation for BMR and standard activity multipliers for TDEE — the same methods used by dietitians. Any equation is an estimate; biology varies. Treat the numbers as a strong starting point and adjust based on how you feel and respond.",
  },
  {
    q: "How often should I update my meal plan?",
    a: "Most users benefit from revisiting their plan every 4–8 weeks or after any meaningful change (new goal, new activity level, weight change of a few kilograms, or a new schedule).",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does it cost?",
    a: "$4.99 as a one-time payment. That includes your initial personalized plan and 2 refinement credits (3 AI generations in total). There is no subscription.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is SmartyDiet medical advice?",
    a: "No. SmartyDiet is a general wellness tool. It is not medical advice, and it is not a substitute for a doctor, registered dietitian or other qualified healthcare professional. If you have a medical condition, are pregnant/breastfeeding, or take medication that affects diet, consult a professional before starting any plan.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I have allergies?",
    a: "Allergies are a required field and the AI is explicitly instructed to exclude every allergen you list. Please be thorough — the plan is only as safe as what you tell us.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I get a refund?",
    a: "If the plan generation fails for a technical reason and we cannot deliver a plan, contact us for a full refund. Because plans are personalized digital content delivered immediately, refunds are otherwise not guaranteed.",
  },
  {
    q: "What do you do with my data?",
    a: "Your questionnaire and plan are stored in your SmartyDiet account so you can access them anytime. We do not sell your data. See our Privacy Policy for full details.",
  },
