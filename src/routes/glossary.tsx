    def: "A composite 0–100 score of a user's current diet across macro balance, micronutrient coverage, food quality, and eating behavior.",
  },
  {
    term: "Smarty Metabolic Age™",
    def: "An estimate of the age a user's metabolism is behaving like, derived from BMR, body composition, activity, and dietary patterns.",
  },
  {
    term: "Smarty Macro Index™",
    def: "How closely a user's actual protein, carb and fat intake matches the optimal split for their body and goal.",

  },
  {
    term: "BMI (Body Mass Index)",
    def: "Weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. A population-level screening metric, not a diagnosis.",
  },
  {
    term: "BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)",
    def: "Calories the body burns at complete rest to keep vital functions running. SmartyDiet uses the Mifflin-St Jeor equation.",

    term: "Macronutrients",
    def: "Protein, carbohydrates and fats — the energy-providing nutrients measured in grams and calories.",

    def: "Vitamins and minerals required in small amounts for enzyme function, immunity, bone health and energy metabolism.",
  },
  {
    term: "Calorie Deficit",
    def: "Eating fewer calories than TDEE. Sustained deficit is the physiological driver of fat loss.",
  },
  {
    term: "Calorie Surplus",
    def: "Eating more calories than TDEE. Required alongside resistance training for meaningful muscle gain.",
  },
  {
    term: "Maintenance Calories",
    def: "Calorie intake equal to TDEE, holding body weight stable over time.",
  },
  {
    term: "Glycemic Index",
    def: "A ranking of carbohydrate foods by how quickly they raise blood glucose relative to pure glucose.",
  },
  {
    term: "Protein Timing",
    def: "Distributing protein across the day (typically 3–5 meals of 20–40 g) to maximize muscle protein synthesis.",
  },
  {
    term: "Meal Frequency",
    def: "The number of eating occasions per day. Total intake matters most; frequency is a preference and adherence lever.",
  },
  {
    term: "Intermittent Fasting",
    def: "Time-restricted eating patterns such as 16:8 or 5:2 that compress daily calorie intake into a shorter window.",
  },
  {
    term: "Mediterranean Diet",
    def: "An eating pattern rich in vegetables, legumes, whole grains, olive oil, fish and moderate dairy, with limited red meat.",
  },
  {
    term: "Ketogenic Diet",
    def: "A very-low-carb, high-fat pattern that shifts primary fuel from glucose to ketone bodies.",
  },

    def: "Foods eaten close to their natural state, with minimal industrial processing.",
  },
  {
    term: "Ultra-Processed Foods",
    def: "Industrial formulations combining refined ingredients and additives — typically high in calories and low in nutrient density.",
  },
  {
    term: "Fiber",
    def: "Indigestible plant carbohydrate that supports satiety, glucose control and gut microbiome health.",
  },
  {
    term: "Hydration",
    def: "Adequate daily fluid intake to support circulation, temperature regulation and cognitive function.",

    term: "Portion Control",
    def: "Managing serving sizes so total intake matches calorie targets without needing to eliminate food groups.",
